\chapter{Conclusion and Future Prospectives}
//conclusion
In this project, we aimed to confirm and reproduce the results from Weder et al. With limited devices, we made our measurement conditions, i.e. optode template configuration and audio sound stimuli as similar as those of the previous research from Weder et al. as possible.

-> almost
->still not yet mentioned the beta and short channel extra cebrelle thingy

//future

what could have gone wrong:
software different
cap position (optode template design and offsets when putting on a cap) mention the broca's area having phasic response (jonas?)

different device, different wavelength

more participants

better understanding of the spatial position with the optode templates (e.g. which channels are over brocas area, which are over supramarginal or caudal superior temporal gyrus, etc.
