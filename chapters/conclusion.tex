%//conclusion
In this project, we aimed to confirm and reproduce the results from Weder et al \cite{Weder2018}. With the limited devices, we made our measurement conditions, i.e. optode template configuration and audio sound stimuli as similar as those of the previous research from Weder et al. \cite{Weder2018} as possible.
